# 🛡️ GitHub Licenses Explained

## 📌 What Are GitHub Licenses?

A GitHub license is a document that defines how others can use, copy, modify, or share your project. Without a license, your code is **not legally open-source**, even if it's publicly visible.

Some popular licenses include:

- **MIT License** – Very permissive, lets anyone use, modify, and distribute your code, even commercially.
- **Apache 2.0** – Like MIT, but adds explicit patent protection.
- **GPLv3** – Strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to also be open-source.
- **BSD License** – Simple and permissive, similar to MIT.
